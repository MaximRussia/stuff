	You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two
	games.
	Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
	Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
	If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should
	you pick one game or the other?
	**/

/**
	Game 1: p = 0.5
	Game 2: P = p*p*p + p*(1-p)*p + p*p*(1-p) + (1-p)*p*p = 3*p2*(1-p) = 3p2-2p3 = 0.75-0.25 = 0.5
